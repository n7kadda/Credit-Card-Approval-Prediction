Credit Card Approval Prediction Project

Welcome to the Credit Card Approval Prediction project repository! This project aims to predict credit card approval decisions using machine learning techniques. By leveraging various features such as demographic information and financial indicators, we aim to build a model that can accurately assess the risk associated with credit card applicants.

Overview

Credit risk assessment is a critical task for financial institutions to mitigate potential losses and maintain a healthy portfolio. Traditional methods of credit evaluation often rely on manual processes and subjective judgment, leading to inefficiencies and inconsistencies. Machine learning offers an opportunity to automate and enhance the credit approval process by leveraging data-driven models to predict creditworthiness.

In this project, we utilize a dataset containing information about credit card applicants, including demographics, financial indicators, and the target variable indicating high-risk applicants. We preprocess the data, train a machine learning model (Random Forest classifier), and evaluate its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the AUC-ROC curve.Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of two main files:

train_data.csv: Contains the training data with features and the target variable.

test_data.csv: Contains the test data for making predictions.

The features include demographic information (e.g., age, gender, marital status), financial indicators (e.g., income, employment status), and a binary target variable indicating whether an applicant is classified as high risk or not.
